# Features for Igbo Converter Framework

## 1. Comprehensive Syntax Conversion
- **Control Structures**: Map Igbo keywords for control structures (e.g., `ma` for `if`, `ọ bụrụ` for `else`, `nọgide` for `while`) to their JavaScript equivalents.
- **Function Definitions**: Allow developers to define functions using Igbo syntax (e.g., `ọrụ` for `function`).

## 2. Data Types and Structures
- **Mapping Basic Data Types**: Create mappings for basic types (e.g., `nọmba` for `number`, `nkọwa` for `string`, `ndekọ` for `array`, `otu` for `object`).
- **Array and Object Initializers**: Support Igbo syntax for initializing arrays and objects.

## 3. Error Handling
- **Igbo Error Messages**: Provide error messages in Igbo for common JavaScript errors, making it easier for Igbo developers to understand issues in their code.
- **Custom Error Handling**: Allow developers to define custom error handling in Igbo.

## 4. Documentation and Comments
- **Igbo Documentation**: Create documentation for the framework in Igbo to help developers understand how to use it.
- **Comment Syntax**: Support comments in Igbo, allowing developers to annotate their code.

## 5. Code Snippet Repository
- **Igbo Code Snippets**: Build a repository of common patterns and snippets written in Igbo that can be converted to JavaScript.
- **Community Contributions**: Allow the community to contribute snippets and enhancements.

## 6. Integration with IDEs
- **Language Server Protocol (LSP)**: Implement an LSP to provide code completion, linting, and error-checking in IDEs like VSCode for Igbo code.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Develop a syntax highlighting theme for Igbo code.

## 7. Transpilation Tools
- **Custom Transpiler**: Create a transpiler that converts Igbo code directly to JavaScript, similar to Babel for modern JavaScript.
- **Online Playground**: Provide an online editor where users can write Igbo code and see the JavaScript output in real-time.

## 8. Localization and Internationalization
- **Multi-language Support**: Allow for multiple languages (e.g., Igbo, English) to make the framework accessible to a broader audience.
- **Language Settings**: Provide options for developers to switch between Igbo and English in the framework.

## 9. Testing Framework
- **Unit Testing in Igbo**: Allow developers to write unit tests in Igbo, which are then converted to a JavaScript testing framework (e.g., Jest or Mocha).
- **Built-in Assertions**: Provide common assertions and test patterns in Igbo.

## 10. Examples and Tutorials
- **Sample Projects**: Provide sample projects that demonstrate how to use the framework for common applications (e.g., web apps, APIs).
- **Video Tutorials**: Create video tutorials in Igbo to teach new developers how to use the framework effectively.

## 11. Community Support
- **Forum or Chat**: Establish a community forum or chat group for Igbo developers to share experiences, ask questions, and collaborate.
- **Mentorship Programs**: Create programs connecting experienced developers with beginners to help them learn.
